# MTD-split/merge
This code has been made available for the purposes of the following papers submitted to: 

Climate Dynamics: "An object-based climatology of precipitation systems in Sydney, Australia"

Science: "Intensification of sub-hourly heavy rainfall"

This is a modified version of the MODE-Time-Domain (MTD) algorithm to track the detected objects in gridded datasets. The modified version handles the split/merge events which is not considered in the original MTD.

Please check the example in MTD-splitmerge.py.
The outputs of the example in MTD-splitmerge.py are "0_Connected_objects" and "0_Tracked.nc" and will be copied in "Output" folder.
